  Hello! I'm a frontend developer with 3 years of experience crafting fast,
  elegant and intuitive interfaces. I balance visual appeal with functional
  excellence, ensuring every detail serves both user needs and business
  objectives.
  <br />
  <br />
  My expertise lies in building and revamping web applications for clients who:

  <div class="mt-2 space-y-2">
    <div>
      <span class="mr-1 font-mono text-teal-500" aria-hidden="true">▹</span> Have
      an MVP requiring performance optimization or maintenance improvements
    </div>

    <div>
      <span class="mr-1 font-mono text-teal-500" aria-hidden="true">▹</span> Need
      a designer-developer hybrid to fully own the frontend process
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />

  I approach development as problem-solving — creating digital experiences that
  people genuinely enjoy using. Currently, I'm enhancing the Arts.Center
  marketplace, developing a seamless experience for artists and buyers.
  <br />
  <br />

  Outside of work, I recharge through tennis, reading, and studying Portuguese.
